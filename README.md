# Blog API Project

## Overview

This repository contains two implementations of a blog API: one using Express and the other using NestJS. Both implementations include a JWT authentication system with token management, role-based authorization, media upload to an S3 bucket, upvote and downvote functionality for posts, comment threads on posts, posts views tracking, and management of post categories and tags.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure authentication with token management.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different roles with specific permissions.
- **Media Upload**: Upload media to an S3 bucket.
- **Voting System**: Upvote and downvote posts.
- **Comment Threads**: Comment on posts and engage in discussions.
- **Posts Views Tracking**: Track and analyze posts views.
- **Post Categories**: Posts can be organized into categories for better content management and navigation.
- **Post Tags**: Posts can be tagged with relevant keywords to facilitate searching and filtering.

## Implementations

### Express

The Express implementation is located in the `express-api` directory.

### NestJS

The NestJS implementation is located in the `nestjs-api` directory.
