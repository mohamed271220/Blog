🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: Blog API 🚀

I've been working on an incredible blog API project, and I’m thrilled to share the key features and technologies integrated into this robust system. Here's an in-depth look at what I've accomplished:

 🌟 Project Highlights 🌟

 🔑 JWT Authentication
Implemented a secure authentication system with token management to ensure user data protection. This ensures that only authenticated users can access certain features.

 🛡️ Role-Based Access Control
Established different roles with specific permissions to manage what actions users can perform. This allows for a clear distinction between admins, editors, and regular users.

 ✨ Media Upload to S3
Enabled users to upload images seamlessly to an Amazon S3 bucket, ensuring efficient and scalable media storage. This feature supports various media types and provides a reliable way to handle large volumes of user-uploaded content.

 👍 Voting System
Developed a dynamic voting system where users can upvote and downvote posts. This feature fosters community interaction and helps highlight popular content within the platform.

 💬 Comment Threads
Added the functionality for users to comment on posts and engage in meaningful discussions. This feature supports nested comments, allowing for in-depth conversations and community engagement.

 📊 Posts Views Tracking
Implemented a feature to track and analyze post views, providing valuable insights into audience engagement and content popularity. This helps in understanding user behavior and optimizing content strategy.

 📂 Post Categories
Organized posts into categories for better content management and navigation.

 🔖 Post Tags
Allowed tagging of posts with relevant keywords to facilitate efficient searching and filtering.

 🔧 Additional Features 🔧

 🐳 Docker & Docker Compose
Set up Docker and Docker Compose to ensure a consistent and reliable development and deployment environment. This simplifies the process of managing dependencies and deploying the application across different environments.

 ⚡ Redis Integration
Configured Redis, making it ready for use to optimize performance and manage data efficiently. Redis is used for caching and session management, which significantly enhances the application's speed and responsiveness.

 📜 API Documentation with Swagger
Documented the entire API using Swagger, ensuring comprehensive and easy-to-follow documentation for developers.

 🚀 Future Plans 🚀

I am planning to rework this project with NestJS to take advantage of its powerful features and scalability. NestJS offers a more modular and maintainable structure, which will help in scaling the application and adding new features more efficiently.
